**ACE3** is a joint effort by the teams behind **ACE2**, **AGM** and **CSE** to improve the realism and authenticity of Arma 3.

The project is entirely **open-source**. Feel free to propose changes or maintain their own, customized version as long as they make their changes open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License (for more information check the license file attached to this project).

The mod is **built modularly**, so almost any PBO can be removed. This way, a team can maintain its own tailored version of ACE that might exclude any components they don't need, or those possibly conflicting with other add-ons. Modules themselves, e.g. the medical system, also include various customization options, allowing mission designers to tweak the overall experience.

### Features
*   Improved medical system
*   Logistics system including cargo transport and vehicle maintenance
*   Explosives system including different trigger types
*   Captivity system
*   Realistic names for vehicles and weapons
*   Realistic ballistics including wind and humidity
*   Backblast simulation
*   A fire control system for armored vehicles and helicopters
    ***and more...***
