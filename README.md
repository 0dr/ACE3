**ACE3** is a joint effort by the teams behind **ACE2**, **AGM** and **CSE** to improve the realism and authenticity of Arma 3.

The project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License:
* [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/blob/master/LICENSE)

The mod is **built modularly**, so almost any included PBO can be easily removed from the configuration. This way, a team can maintain its own tailored version of ACE by simply excluding any components they don't need, or those that might possibly conflict with other add-ons. Modules themselves, e.g. the medical system, also include various customization options, allowing mission designers to tweak the overall experience.

### Features
* Improved medical system
* Logistics system including cargo transport and vehicle maintenance
* Explosives system including different trigger types
* Captivity system
* Realistic names for vehicles and weapons
* Realistic ballistics including wind and humidity
* Backblast simulation
* A fire control system for armored vehicles and helicopters<br />
  ***and more...***

*  [Getting started](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/blob/master/documentation/user/getting-started.md)

#### Contributing
You can help out with the ongoing development by looking for potential bugs in our code base, or by contributing new features. To contribute something to ACE, simply fork this repository and submit your pull requests for review by other collaborators. Remember to add yourself to the author array of any PBO you will be editing and the [`AUTHORS.txt`](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt) file; including a valid email address.

Please, use our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/issues) to report a bug, propose a feature, or suggest changes to the existing ones. See also:
