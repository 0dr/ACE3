Legacy Module for cse_sys_windDeflection.
by Glowbal. Modifications by Ruthberg.

This module has been integrated into cse_sys_ballistics as part of the CSE project restructure. 
The module will stay available to allow for backwards compatibilty. All functionality will remain the same as in previous CSE versions.

------------
Adjustments made:
- Improved ballistics calculation based upon Ruthberg's advancedBallistics code. 
- Adjusted paths to direct to cse\cse_sys_ballistics\basicBallistics instead of cse\cse_sys_windDeflection.
