Different shell types have different effects:

ACE_shellType = "HEAT" || "TANDEM-HEAT" || "HE" || "HESH" || "SABOT" || "SABOT-DU"

- HEAT spawns new ammo upon impact (like RAM), defeated by ERA, creates spall
  inside if it penetrates
- TANDEM-HEAT is just like HEAT, but not defeated by ERA
- HE only affects light armored vehicles (can cause cracks maybe?)
- HESH spawns new ammo with the velocity of the inverse surface normal (because
  it splashes onto the surface) and creates spall inside if the new projectile
  "penetrates", defeated by spall liner
- SABOT almost always penetrates but creates less spall
- SABOT-DU is just like SABOT, but has a higher chance to cause fire/cookoff

No ACE config: Check explosive and direct hit value, decide between HEAT, HE
and SABOT.

Just like in ACE2 we're just defining generic areas for ERA:
Front, Back, Left, Right, Top
Numbers are the coverage percentages. So 0 means 100% chance of HE pen,
0.5 50% chance of HE pen etc. With each hit, a part of the ERA gets blown
off and the pen chance increases (depending on the area).

Example T72B1 (http://www.smallscaleafv.com/inspiration/albums/sergey-golikov/t-72b1/t72-golikov-08.jpg):

ACE_era_hull[] = {0.8, 0, 0.7, 0.7, 0.2};
ACE_era_turret[] = {1, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5};

No ACE config = no ERA.

Spall liner has an effect on the crew damage. Less spall = less dead.

ACE_hasSpallLiner = 1;

Spall itself is not created through the frag system. Although that could be
done, it would probably simply stop within a vehicle (due to low velocity and
collision) and would cost performance. Instead we simply assign probabilities
for crew injures.
When the turret gets hit, the units occupying the turret are pretty much
guaranteed to be dead. Due to the spall bouncing around within the vehicle, it
also injures everybody in the hull - just not as much.
However, we need to know who is where because in APCs for example, the
commander often sits in the hull, or for special snowflakes like the T-14 where
driver and gunner sit in the hull.

ACE_unitsInTurret[] = {"GUNNER", "COMMANDER"};
ACE_unitsInHull[] = {"DRIVER", "CREW"};

The above should be the default configuration for vehicles with no proper ACE
config.

---

For cookoffs, we need to know where the ammunition sits. Although the
ammunition that gets loaded is normally taken from the turret, once that is
used up the crew transfers new ammunition into the turret. We cannot really
simulate that unless we create a custom system for it - we could, not sure if
people would like that though.
Instead we take the easy approach and simply give both hull and turret a
certain chance of ammo being hit.

ACE_ammoHitChance_turret = 0.5;
ACE_ammoHitChance_hull = 0.3;

This chance is influenced by available ammo. No ammo = no cookoff.

---

Additionally blowout panels like on the Abrams should influence if the crew
gets injured by cookoffs, or rather how much.

ACE_hasBlowoutPanels = 1;

Active defense systems are another thing that should be taken into
consideration. I'd prefer to put it into a seperate module though.
