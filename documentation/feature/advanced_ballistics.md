# Overview
## Advanced ballistics simulation
Advanced ballistics changes above and beyond the ballistics module. Bullet characteristics, barrel length, air temperature, barometric pressure, ammo temperature and air drag are all used to dynamically calculate ballistics.

## Protractor
Adds a protractor for quick reference when sniping.

# Usage
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> to display the protractor.

This module uses relatively complex scripting. Several options are provided in the ACE menu to reduce the performance impact of this module.

# Dependencies
`ace_ballistics`, `ace_weather`, `ace_modules`
